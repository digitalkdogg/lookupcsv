243,7087,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Our store believes that financial contributions within our community are important, but we also believe our associates can make a huge difference by volunteering their time to help local organizations whenever a need arises.  We made a commitment to help a group that was connected to our community in some way each month of this year.
In February, we assisted with a ""Polar Plunge"" that helped raise money for our local Special Olympics team. Our associates cheered on those who were participating, and we even had an associate's daughter  who took the plunge themselves. Our March event involved a group of our associates who helped our local Department of Child Services with their ""Pinwheels for Prevention"" by placing pinwheels along roads throughout the county to help remind the community of the importance of child abuse prevention.  April had our associates visiting our local food bank to volunteer and see how our food donations were being used to benefit the community we live and work in. We helped unpack and organize donations and were able to learn how the process of feeding those in need actually comes about. Our May organization was the Washington County Animal Shelter. Our pet food donations have been given to the shelter for many years. Our associates now had the chance to visit the shelter and help out by cleaning up around cages, assisting with feeding the animals, and loving on some animals that were looking for some affection. The month of July saw a chance to help the Jackson County History Center by volunteering our time with them for the Ride for Riley event. The History Center and our store combined our teams to organize and facilitate this event to help raise money for Riley Children's Hospital, our Children's Miracle Network Hospital. Several of our associates spent time in August volunteering for our Salem City Soccer season. Our associates helped by refereeing and coaching at several games throughout the season. In September, our store presented a Community Car Show to help raise money for Riley Hospital. We worked with members of the community to organize a car show for our local car buffs to bring in their cars to show them off to the public and help raise money for a good cause.  We incorporated other events such as face painting and duck ponds to help add to the events engagement. The October event was a Trunk or Treat held in our very own Walmart parking lot. Our associates volunteered their time decorating their cars to the theme of their choice and invited the community to bring their children out to the event for trick or treating fun. November events included assisting The Crothersville FFA with their preparations for their annual Toy & Food Drive. Our associates assisted by helping with the food collection and by working with organizers to promote the event within our community, a neighbor to the Crothersville area. December, a time to truly focus on giving, brought ""Cram the Cruiser"" to our Salem Walmart.  The local police department parked a car on our front sidewalk, and our associates and community worked to bring donations in to help ""fill"" the police car with items to help benefit the community we serve. 
We work hard to give back to the community that has welcomed us and supports our store. These are the highlights of our monthly commitment to help different organizations surrounding our store, but we will continually strive to help out in any situation that occurs. Our customers will always be our number one priority. By being involved in their community, we are helping them live better."
247,1294,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"1294 has been giving back to the community for years since, Yvonne, the store manager has taken role there. They have partnered with the YMCA for Healthy Kids Event Day along with starting their own tradition with the Rescue Mission a few years ago where they host their annual Thanks For Giving Food Drive.  The food drive accumulated about 3200lbs of food and it was used to feed multiple low income families, residents of the rescue mission, and even over 100 families from our local grade school.  Yvonne, also serves on the board with the local rescue mission.  The rescue mission takes in the homeless along with their partner ""Open Heart"" which takes in women and children who did not have a shelter to live in.  1294 has a great relationship also with their local police department and this past year they helped with a big event ""Youth Stem"" summer camp. The facility doesn't limit their VAP hours to just the rescue mission or YMCA - they have given time to Crime Stoppers with their golf scramble, volunteering at the soup kitchen in town, giving supplies to help build beds for CSI ministries, helping kids receive the needs from parents who are incarcerated, Wreaths across America, Converse Church of Christ with families who can't afford Christmas, Cancer walks that are hosted by the Grant County Walk of Hope, and giving time to the Rescue Mission golf scramble to raise funds for the residents to live in.  The time and grant money that this facility has given to the rescue mission has not only helped the ones in our community but they have helped our community stay off the streets.  The rescue mission feeds 3 times a day and they could not feed our community without the help of 1294 that gives hours of VAP and donations given from our community along with the associates at the store who help provide this.  The community, our customers,  partners with this particular store to help provide to the residents who live in Grant County.  It is definitely heart felt to see how the community reacts to the needs of their own community and helps Walmart help donate time and needs to those who are less fortunate.  The community has not reacted in this heart felt way until Yvonne started the tradition of the Thanks for Giving Food Drive.  She helps associates see the need of giving and volunteering as these customers are also the ones who stay in the mission.  Giving back to the community has always been near their heart here in Marion as they were the community's spotlight for community sharing given by the Chamber of Commerce.    "

We are nominating this store for the award because of the higher than average number of times we have observed the store supporting the community in the form of merchandise discounts and donations of things like Bikes, School Supplies, and Thanksgiving Turkeys - in addition to smaller once off contributions to organizations that are important to the Tribal Community of Montana.

We also wanted to recognize the facility because it has demonstrated excellent turn around results operationally in the last year, going from negative comps and operational opportunities to best in class comp sales - the effort which they have made to help deliver a good experience for customers in this isolated community - where Walmart matters even more than in other places - has been incredibly meaningful to the shoppers there."

The store is also very involved with the Heart of Jackson Humane Society including associates volunteering and serving on the board.

430,2990,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,"When you come to Mitchell, South Dakota, we don’t have a Walmart. Instead in our cozy town of sixteen thousand people, we have Mitchell’s Walmart. The associates in this community’s store work hard, not just to make sure the shelves are full, but to make sure their family and neighbors are taken care of. The associates didn’t just hit their metrics, beat their plan, or build their scores. Their work and success meant that Mitchell's Walmart provided our community with strength and support inside and outside our four walls.

Over the last year, the team spent over 40 hours volunteering in events like the community fair and food bank, where they were able to reach out to their neighbors, provide meals, and help raise vital funds for local schools. With events like stuff the bus and pack it back, we were able to stock over 19 classrooms and supply 55 kids with everything from new school clothes to supplies. We also work in the backpack program, donating time and food so kids have something to fill their tummy up after class at home.

The associates raised money to provide over 15 kids without beds; not just the mattress, but entire bed sets with their own sheets, through Mitchell’s Caring Closet. They also helped to provide support and essentials to over 30 women and children in need, with clothes, bags, and food, as they transition into stable living. We lead activities like Cozy Coat where people come and drop items they have bought or wore out to give to their neighbors in need. 

Through the help of the community and the dedication of the store, we worked with the ‘Community of Business’ here in Mitchell to raise and donate over $10k of supplies to build ""Make it Home"" bags for neighbors who have experienced tragedy through fires, sexual assault, or homelessness and provide them with items to start fresh with along with a support team to help.

The store has sponsored over 75 kids to ensure they get everything they want and need for Christmas this year, as well as 17 children for Halloween that got to come pick out their costumes and get a treat bag made by our associates. We have actively worked with CASA to supply over 2k worth of supplies to kids who are transitioning into temporary living to make sure they have something to call their own. We also partnered with the local children's hospital to donate supplies to give families as they spend their holiday around the hospital and make they time with their kids still feel like a little bit of magic.

This is just the start, with many more works in the community including times like their effort making food for veterans on holidays or supporting the local public safety departments through volunteering to clean up the community with them. Our team is always excited for the chance to help some of our community's heroes. To my team, it's not about what they get from it; it’s about how they were able to help their family, their neighbors, and their friends. It's about being proud to be Mitchell’s Walmart."

Next, outlined below is a summary of our approach for strengthening the local community, outlined in what we consider to be our Core Four:  Veterans, Youth, Sustainability, and Community Programs.  You will also find our focus for FY23 and beyond to be well-aligned with our local economy's current needs and priorities.  I am certain that, after reviewing our candidacy, you will conclude that this facility embodies Mrs. Walton's drive to further the community, and be confident in our ability to deliver this honor to Market 475.  

 

 Veterans 

One of our greatest and most unrivaled strengths is the dedication we give to honoring and supporting our veterans, and not just by our city-renowned Wall of Honor.  Supporting servicemen and women is an area where I am more than proud to lead by example, especially with my daughter's service to our country. The VFW continues to give us praise for our dedication, and even volunteer to replace/maintain our flag, free of charge. I also have the privilege of serving as head judge for the VFW 4th of July Parade. Our November 11th Veteran’s Day Celebration event was a major success. Held in front of the Wall of Honor, we had the opportunity to recognized local veterans—including some of our associates.  

 

Investing in Our Youth 

Supporting an environment whereby our community's youth can thrive and excel is a staple of 2492's outreach platform.  We continue to sponsor local programs designed to pave a clear path for our younger generation, such as Pendleton's Movies in the Park, where we donated door prizes for the event, and the Pendleton Children’s Center, which received a $500 grant. We also issued $1000 grants to both the Buckaroo Baseball Club and the Arts Council of Pendleton. Lastly, we were a sponsor of the June 18th Wild West Beerfest, which raised money for children from low-income families within the community to participate in programs such as the After School Program and Summer Adventure Camp.  
 

Local Sustainability 

A large segment of our community is actively engaged, or even dependent, on local farms.  As such, a vigorous and earth-conscientious program is in place which provided over 5500 pounds of feed to the community's livestock.  With this, we have removed an immeasurable amount of waste while providing agriculturists with some much-needed savings.  But we didn't stop there.  Expanding on care for our animals, we recently worked with PAWS, a local animal care organization, to put on the Betty White Petfood Drive, a multi-day where customers showed up in numbers to offer donations which 2492 proudly matched, up to $100 a day. Finally, we are pleased to sponsor Scotty, a Pendleton Police Department K9 with a special diet, by supplying his food every month.  

 

Community Support and Programs 

The City of Pendleton and its surrounding communities continue to consider our facility as a supporting pillar of the local economy.  Aside from providing careers and savings to our residents, 2492 also plays an active role in furthering local programs, such as the Pendleton Warming Station’s Neighbor 2 Neighbor program, Domestic Violence services, and Cowboy Christmas, the latter being a secret Santa-type event for local organizations during the Holiday Season. I also personally serve on the Board of Directors for both the Pendleton Chamber of Commerce and the Pendleton Cancer Center, giving the store further visibility to the town's needs. Our associates are following this leadership, with many actively engaged in community programs. Lastly, we continue to maintain 100% grant distribution, gaining an increase in allotments year after year. 

 

When it comes to community support, you will agree that our facility's passion and dedication are simply inimitable among the market.  With a clear, precise vision in mind, we continue to propel the City of Pendleton—and Store 2492—in an upwards direction.  For this reason, I am more than confident that we can and will be recognized as the market's—and, indeed, the company's—clear choice for the Helen Walton Award this year.

During the school years our associates went out to the local schools, presenting our local teachers with food trays and items donated to the store and were so excited to do so.  We have a regular weekly customer who goes out in the community once a month to donate personal items, and since this was a personal mission of this customer to help the local homeless, our associates stepped up and purchases items to help create 80 bags that were donated.  During our local CMN campaign, our associates donated personal items to help raise money at our CMN yardsale, bringing in big $ amounts to help us raise $1000. They are always wanting to help, recognize our community whether it is law enforcement, local schools or just everyday customers who want to do good deeds.  I think our associates are selfless, always putting others before themselves, and I would love them to be recognized for this amazing acts of kindness.
