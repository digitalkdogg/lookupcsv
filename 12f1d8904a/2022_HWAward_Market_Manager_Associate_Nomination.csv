Just recently we had a very bad fire that kept him busy most of the cold bitter night in town; followed just days later by a missing special needs young community member who wandered from home.  Cory spent more that 24 hours in the sub freezing night searching the town and even helping coordinate a dive team to scour the icy waters on the Susquehanna to help find this individual.

He helps along the sidelines at local football games, can been seen umping a summer ball game or just jumping in anywhere there is a need - just like he does every night he's here at work.  He's been spotted on the firetruck leading the Santa parade and tossing candy to all the kiddos lining the street.  Cory never asks for anything, but is the first one to offer help in anyone's time of need.  His laugh and smile are almost as big as his heart.

Erna & Lori assist our associates in everyway they can daily.  They start by making sure there is simple food in the breakroom so no one goes hungry, they cook for our events instead of catering so they may provide more variety and, associates may take leftovers home for a hot meal they may not have otherwise.  These ladies are always there when you need someone to talk to and guide you to the answers Walmart provides such as Resources for living.  We have had associates living in the parking lot and these ladies help them get food and shelter.  Our associates know these ladies will always celebrate the smallest of life events to the large ones and always ask something like is your daughter feeling better?, How was the birthday party? or just a simple good morning, a smile and acknowledgement mean a lot.  These ladies always
make themselves available no matter how busy they are.  They are the meaning of our Walmart Family.
Community- Erna & Lori are always the first our community comes to for volunteers.  The City Council, Chamber, Police, Schools, are just a few who know they can count on them, for labor or a donation.  Even some of our small businesses ask us to help with their getting involved with the community.

44,410,242,Karen Blanck,Walmart Stores,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,"Karen Blanck has been an amazing advocate and representative for Walmart in the community of Paola for all 43 years of her Walmart career. Over the course of that time, she has made invaluable connections with the community, it's leaders, and the people with whom she shares this wonderful town. She has become a source of information and help for many that live here, whether that is simply being a friendly smile and a helping hand with finding an item in the store, or informing, educating, and helping our community members navigate all of the ways that Walmart as a store and a company can help them. In this year alone, I know Karen has been directly involved with reaching out to and helping three such organizations with navigating the Front Door Verification Process, and educating them on all that this verification offers them, so that we can support them through Grants, Donations, Fundraising, etc.. In addtion, she has been a supporter of and has become a constant point of contact in the community that organizations have felt comfortable reaching out to over decades, anytime they need help and support, such as Lighthouse Presbyterian Church, the Paola School District USD 368, the Untited Way, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Miami County Cancer Foundation, to name just a few. I have only been with this store for a couple of years now, but this connection through her into the heart of our community, has afforded me, as well as Walmart, the opportunity to support the people that support us. Most notably, Karen, has not only been a source of knowledge for, but also a very active supporter and contributer to the Cops for Tots program, run by the Miami County Sheriff's Department. In my time here, I have seen Karen volunteer countless hours, helping at events around the community, that raise money for this organization that helps so many. She has walked in parades, assisted with coordinating and running car shows, toy drives, concession stands, and more. I have even seen Karen use her own personal funds to buy things when the organization is in need, whether it be supplies for fundraising events or toys directly, all so that she can donate them to the cause without any expectation of thanks or recognition. This is just an example, of course, of her character, which is what inspires me the most. Karen is one of the most giving, kind, and professional people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. In every decission I've seen Karen make, she has done so with the sole intention of helping others, whether that is in her daily work for her associates and customers or for the community that she loves. She does it not because she thinks anyone will notice, but because she is always there to help find solutions and to support people in any way that she believes will help them. If you talk to those that have been fortunate enough to work with her for years, they can give you numerous examples and stories of how she has been an amazing and inspirational leader in not only the store, but also this community, and I can only hope that others will speak about me one day, with the appreciation and respect with which they speak about Karen. Walmart's mission may be to save our customers money and time, so that they can live better lives, but I truly believe that Karen's only mission is to help the people in this community live better lives, in any ways that she can think of.",tsbalsm.s00242@us.wal-mart.com,tsbalsm.s00242,2022-12-09T20:25:37.600Z,4477,Travis Moore

A few individuals within several organizations in city decided to begin cleaning up glass & organizing paint days for lights & bathrooms. Local social media picked up on it & the group became a movement in which the park gained several 'upgrades', such as new lighting, new playground equipment, & a new memorial for the veteran the park is named after. There was a new splash pad built & Michael J Hunter's brother even attended the Juneteenth celebration. This associate has been very vocal in why these 'improvements' are made, citing that under privileged youth shouldn't have to fight to be children.

They have partnered with the YMCA for Healthy Kids Event Day along with starting their own tradition with the Rescue Mission a few years ago where they host their annual Thanks For Giving Food Drive.  The food drive accumulated about 3200lbs of food and it was used to feed multiple low income families, residents of the rescue mission, and even over 100 families from our local grade school.  Yvonne, also serves on the board with the local rescue mission.  The rescue mission takes in the homeless along with their partner ""Open Heart"" which takes in women and children who did not have a shelter to live in.  1294 has a great relationship also with their local police department and this past year they helped with a big event ""Youth Stem"" summer camp. The facility doesn't limit their VAP hours to just the rescue mission or YMCA - they have given time to Crime Stoppers with their golf scramble, volunteering at the soup kitchen in town, giving supplies to help build beds for CSI ministries, helping kids receive the needs from parents who are incarcerated, Wreaths across America, Converse Church of Christ with families who can't afford Christmas, Cancer walks that are hosted by the Grant County Walk of Hope, and giving time to the Rescue Mission golf scramble to raise funds for the residents to live in.  The time and grant money that this facility has given to the rescue mission has not only helped the ones in our community but they have helped our community stay off the streets.  The rescue mission feeds 3 times a day and they could not feed our community without the help of 1294 that gives hours of VAP and donations given from our community along with the associates at the store who help provide this.  The community, our customers,  partners with this particular store to help provide to the residents who live in Grant County.  It is definitely heart felt to see how the community reacts to the needs of their own community and helps Walmart help donate time and needs to those who are less fortunate.  The community has not reacted in this heart felt way until Yvonne started the tradition of the Thanks for Giving Food Drive.  She helps associates see the need of giving and volunteering as these customers are also the ones who stay in the mission.  Giving back to the community has always been near their heart here in Marion as they were the community's spotlight for community sharing given by the Chamber of Commerce.

Josh started to volunteer his time for this event back in 2018 when he was an academy facilitator at my store.  Since my store is so close to the Air Force base, Josh tried finding something that our associates would be passionate about and that they could also relate to and support out in the community.  Back in 2018 it was just Josh and another academy facilitator volunteering their time at the yearly March for the Fallen ruck run.  Josh and the other facilitator set up a Walmart table and handed out fruits, granola bars and water.  As the years have passed the event has gotten bigger and bigger with participation and we had associates from market 473 and 474 show up to volunteer their time.  In total we had around 40 associates show up representing 6 different Walmart stores.  This past year Josh was able to get a film crew from the HO to show up and do a story about this amazing event.  The video was broadcasted at the HO during the Veterans Day. It's important that we showcase all the great things that Walmart does out in the community.  This event is a great opportunity for Walmart to be seen in a different light by our community and have customers' perception changed about who we are and what we do.

Ray took the opportunity to introduce himself to the family.  The family as it turned out was getting away from a very dangerous situation.  Ray was able to help this family in need find immediate housing, food, and financial assistance through his various contacts in the area.  This family is now thriving in their new community because of Rays influence and dedication to serving others.  Ray is very humble in all that he does and is quite when accepting praise for those he serves.  There are many of deserving individuals who are recommended and Ray is one of them.  The hours in VAP do not reflect the countless hours Ray has put in year after year.  I have shown him the process of submitting VAP events and Hours served so he understands the process.

14,3,681,Brandon Cahela,Walmart Stores,Yes,Yes,No,No,"Rose Acres Rescue, established in July 2015, is a non-profit 501c(3) organization based out of Attalla, Alabama. The rescue is primarily an 11th hour rescue that works closely with surrounding shelters and pounds to give adoptable dogs and cats a 2nd chance at life by offering temporary or permanent residence when stray holds expire.

Brandon  has been volunteering with Rose Acres Rescue since 2014. He helped clear the land and build structures the year prior to the grand opening and still help weekly. While at the rescue, He aided in training animals to have basic obedience, cleaning kennels, building structures, feeding, transporting animals, and working with other agencies to find animals forever homes.

While at the rescue, Brandon helps transport animals to/from vets, possible adopters, and adoption events. Having background experience in dog training and animal protection training allows him to help handle larger breeds that are often misunderstood, allowing them to have a greater success rate at a second life.  Most animals are scared when life changes for them so volunteering offers a sense of security to those animals while we look for families to adopt and find forever homes.

Brandon also stays on call 24/7 to transport animals to emergency vet clinics when the opportunity arises. He shares how he enjoys the time working with animals and helping them find their forever families and home. Brandon's family also enjoys spending time together working at the rescue and this allows for family time as well as volunteering together.
